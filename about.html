		<h2>About Me</h2>
		<p>Well, I am not the type of guy that gives a flood of blah when being asked "tell me a little bit about yourself". But since I am setting up an About Me page, it would be rude to leave this page blank.</p>
    <p>My name is Jacob and I work & live in Shanghai, China, working for one of the major 4A advertising comapnies.</p>
    <p>Believe or not, my daily job has nothing to do anything technical, and the most complicated software I use every day at work are Microsoft Office and Skype. That's it.</p>
    <p>I learn and practice programming in my spare time, because, well, I believe brain is like muscle. If you don't use it much, it'll get floppy. And I don't like floppy things.</p>
    <p>So most of the stuff here will be about programming, but you can also see random thoughts and rants. Maybe the latter will even take a larger percent.</p>
    <p>If you keep following this blog, you may be lucky enough to see photos of my wife, children and dog.</p>
    <p>Oh, by "programming", I mean writing ugly pieces of codes that I lock in my drawer that I'm too shy to show other people.</p>
