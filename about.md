Well, I am not the type of guy that gives a flood of blah when being asked "tell me a little bit about yourself". But since I am setting up an About Me page, it would be rude to leave this page blank.

My name is Jacob and I work & live in Shanghai, China, working for one of the major 4A advertising companies.

Believe or not, my daily job has nothing to do with anything technical, and the most complicated software I use at work every day are Microsoft Office and Skype. That's it.

I learn and practice programming in my spare time, because, well, I believe brain is like muscle. If you don't use it much, it'll get floppy.</p> 

And I don't like floppy things.
    
To sum it up, most of the stuff here will be about programming, but you can also see random thoughts and rants. Maybe the latter will even take a larger percent.

If you keep following this blog, you may be lucky enough to see photos of my wife, children and dog.

Oh, by "programming", I mean writing ugly pieces of codes that I lock in my drawer I'm too shy to show other people.
