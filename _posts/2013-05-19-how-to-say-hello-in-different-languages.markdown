Ever wondering how to say hello in different languages? Here I'm maintaining a list, because I think it's always cool to greet people in their own languages, even though that may be the only word you can say in their languages.

If you are from a country where English is not the mother tongue, why not teach me how to say hello in your language by leaving a comment below?

Oh by the way you can also teach me how to say thank you, so I will be able to include that in my reply :)

English: Hello

Korean: Annyeong-haseyo

Ukurain: Привіт

Italian: Ciao

Japanese: Konnichiwa

Greek: Yassou
