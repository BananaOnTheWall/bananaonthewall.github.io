Most of the time a title like this is a clear indicator the post is full of crap. But trust me, this one is not.

But i want to clarify - I am no psychologist. What makes me think myself qualified to give tips on fighting procrastination is only the fact that I procrastinated myself like hell, and I have managed to make it a lot better now.

So this article is basically a patient-to-patient talk.

Wait, don't put this post in your Read Later app. You are just procrastinating again. Many people seldom read stuff they have read-later'ed, especially when they have a lot of unread articles.

Okay let's begin.

###1\. Not a Problem of Willpower

Many people, even some psychologists tend to relate procrastination to weak willpower and decipher it as something similar with laziness.

I am not sure if they are right. But even if they are right, their theory is not really helpful or practical for people to fight procrastination.

Because that will only lead you to another game of willpower in your life - you are procrastinating? Okay that's because your willpower is not strong enough.

But how the hell can I improve my willpower? Should I press my finger on a hot coffee cup and see how long I can stand? Or deliberately go against humanity, telling myself game is boring and work is fun?

That may work for some people, but not me. I don't want to force myself to do anything. Being forced, either by others or yourself, will only make things worse.

Actually being forced is one of the top reasons why people procrastinate.

There should be a better, and happier way.

###2\. The Normal Thinking Process

let's recall our thinking process when we normally do something:

Step 1 -  we **have the thought of doing something**, like go returning the DVDs, or pick your kids from school. Our mood is neutral at the moment.

Step 2 - we **start to work** on the tasks. If the tasks are not so fun or very challenging, negative thoughts will arise in the process, such as anxiety, nervousness, anger, fear and hopelessness, like when I am doing the dishes.

Step 3 - We **finish the tasks**. We feel relieved, usually with a sense of accomplishment \(and maybe a candy as well\), which will make you happy.

###3\. Why People Procrastinate?

Now, after repeating the process a few times, our brain learns and remembers the process. It will release the negative feelings **BEFORE** you really start to start to work on the tasks, namely between Step 1 and Step 2.

I don't know why, maybe some sort of self-protection mechanism of the human body.

That's why you procrastinate! You are only human, and normal human don't like negative feelings!

So don't feel bad if you procrastinate. Congrats you are not crazy!

###4\. How I Solved It?

The solution I figured out myself was actually very simple. Since I can't force myself to be crazy enough to embrace the negative feelings with willpower, or the Force, why don't I find some positive feelings, to neutralize or even beat the negative? Like when you were a kid, your parents bought you candy before taking you to see a doctor.

And it's not hard to find - there it is: the sense of accomplishment, in Step 3!

Now whenever I get haunted by the negative feelings, and want to procrastinate again, I tell myself: “If you complete it, you will feel happy. ”

Instead of being scared by the negative feelings in Step 2, I ask my brain to directly skip to positive feelings in Step 3. 

Then work becomes fun and I become magically motivated to do stuff right away.

That's it. Simple, quick and powerful, like magic spells in Harry Potter.

Try it yourself next time you want to procrastinate, and you will thank me.

Thanks for reading this post. If you have your own ways to solve procrastination, it would be great if you could share it in the comment.
