There are some bad thoughts that are lingering in my head recently. The tricky part is, I know these thoughts are wrong, but I tend to believe in them.

One of them is, do some people, really deserve as much rights as the others?

I used to believe they do, but am not so sure now.

Maybe it's not about reason at all - just I'm in bad mood.
