Today I decided to cancel my Evernote Premium subscription. The only reason why I subscribed is because I wanted to share editable notebooks with my wife and now I don't think it's work the 50 USD annual fee anymore.

So I cancelled the subscription and my premium features will remain active until the end of the current billing circle.

To my surprise, I found my wife's account, which is a free account and has never gone premium, can now share editable notebooks with me too.

I googled a little bit and found these two posts in the forum of Evernote:

[Evernote sharing in free version supports edit?](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/65342-evernote-sharing-in-free-version-supports-edit/)

And

[Sharing Editable Notebooks - Two Premium Accounts, or One?](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/63850-sharing-editable-notebooks-two-premium-accounts-or-one/)

Seems free users can now share one editable notebook too.

Sweet!
