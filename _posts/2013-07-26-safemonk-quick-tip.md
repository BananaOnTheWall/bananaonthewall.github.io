title: SafeMonk May Not Encrypt Your Files

SafeMonk is the encryption service I use for Dropbox. It is a pretty neat app, which can encrypt your important and private files very fast before they are uploaded to the Dropbox servers.

Today when I used SafeMonk, I found something interesting that you may not have noticed if you are a SafeMonk user too, which is that **your files will only be encrypted if you have SafeMonk running when you put files in the SafeMonk folder.**

I created a txt file with the text "Hello World" in it and found it was **not encrypted** when I put it in the SafeMonk folder (you can only see a shortcut for SafeMonk folder in the Dropbox folder when SafeMonk is not running) first without having SafeMonk running, even I started SafeMonk right after I put it there. And after that, no matter how many times I restarted SafeMonk, the file was still unencrypted. The only way to make SafeMonk encrypt it is move it out of the SafeMonk folder, start SafeMonk and put it back to the SafeMonk again.

So what's the takeaway? Always make sure SafeMonk is running before you put new files into the folder. Always. Otherwise your files are not encrypted.

May the Monk bless you!
