This article serves as a simple guide on things you need to take into consideration when buying a VPN service, if you care about privacy and personal data safety.

But I'd like to give a heads-up to the readers, if any, this article will not walk you through how VPN works or other technical details regarding the structure of a virtual private network, due to the fact that my knowledge is very much limited in this area.

Below are the questions I recommend asking the service provider when you buy a VPN, and I do believe I will extend the list as I become more knowledgable on the topic:

1. How do you protect traffic that goes through your servers?

2. Do you keep activity logs? If so, what details are included in the logs?

3. Which country is your company registered in?

4. Under what circumstances, does your company share user data with third parties? For example, a request from the gov, on condition that a user is suspected responsible for certain illegal or terrorist activities.

5. How do you store the payment information, such as the credit card numbers? Because information like that can also be used to easily spot the identities of users in real world, which severely reduces the anonymity of your service.
