Before sharing my humble options, I'd like to clarify two things, just in case you think I have taken a side.

1. Democracy is worth fighting for.
2. CCP is an evil dictatorship.

The decline of Hong Kong's economy is NOT CPP's fault. You may disagree, but please read on first.

Hong Kong became an international manufacturing/transportation/financial center, because the world needed one at that region.

Back then Mainland was like today's DPRK, shutting its door to other countries, so Hong Kong was chosen. But when Mainland started becoming more open, especially with the massive cheap labor force, international investors were inevitably shifting from Hong Kong to Mainland.

(They are leaving China now though. That's another story)

You may be wondering, Singapore was a lot like Hong Kong, but why is SG doing much better? 

Because Singapore has Temasek Holdings.

That's it. Again, I'm not taking a side. These are just my poorly organised thoughts on the recent protests in Hong Kong.

Go Hong Kong! But be safe.
