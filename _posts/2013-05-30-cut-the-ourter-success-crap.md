Internet is a darn noisy place. Every day, you eyes are bombed by all sorts information that flows down your desktop.

There is one particular type of content - success stories.

Like this guy made a product that was sold for millions, that dude launched something else that attracted hundreds of thousands of sign ups over night…

Stuff like that.

Don't get me wrong. I have no problems with those successful people.

I have problems with you.

If you run a startup, you should cut the habit of reading stuff like that every day. Below is why:

##1\. They don't read them

I don't believe in money but I am going to admit it: having money is better than not; having more money is generally better than less.

Now here is the But moment - the successful people you read about every day don't become successful by reading about other successful people.

They sit down and work their ass off.

Plus, a little or a lot of luck.

##2. They distract you

Money, or success is tempting. You can easily get lost in all sorts of them and don't know who you are and what you should do.

“Somebody launches a photo app and becomes successful, maybe I should do that too…”

No you shouldn't. You are good at something else.

##3. They don't admit they are lucky

Successful people work hard, but that doesn't mean you are guaranteed to be successful if you work hard.

Sometimes, it is just luck, although no successful people want to admit that. Because that will fade their stories in which they package themselves as some sort of son of gods.

This may lead into frustration - why that guy succeeds while I am not? Ain't I smart or hard-working enough?

Well, he doesn't tell you his VC happens to be his aunt, does he?

And, frustration kills productivity.

Okay, that's all for my rants today. Now I am going to sit down and do stuff.

Later.
